    <h1>Learn to Crochet</h1>
    <b>What is Crochet?</b>
    <p>Crochet is a handicraft that uses a single hook to create fabric by pulling yarn through loops in a series of stitches. It is commonly used to make items such as clothing, blankets, accessories, and decorations. Crochet is known for its flexibility because stitches are made one at a time, making it easier to correct mistakes and adjust designs. With just a hook and yarn, people can create a wide variety of textures and patterns, which makes crochet both a practical and creative craft.</p>

<h2>Starting Foundations</h2>
    <p>First, hold the crochet hook with your dominant hand. Apply either a pencil grip or a knife grip.</p>
    <p>Make a slip knot by holding your index and middle fingers on your non-dominant hand.</p>
    <p>Then wrap the yarn around your fingers to form an X, starting from the bottom left to upper right in front of your fingers, upper right to down right on the back of your fingers, then down right to upper left.</p>
    <p>After that, pass the working yarn (The yarn piece connected to the skein/ball of yarn) and tighten and adjust the yarn to your liking.</p>
    <p>Then start chaining by inserting your hook through the loop of your slip knot and pulling the working yarn through.</p>
    <p>Repeat until you have your desired length. This will serve as your foundation.</p>
    <p>If the pattern you are following has a magic ring/circle foundation, follow the steps of the X of a slip knot and pull the working yarn through only a little bit.</p>
    <p>Then twist the hook clockwise, facing away from you.</p>
    <p>Start chaining for how many your pattern needs.</p>

<h2>Single Crochet</h2>
    <p>If your pattern starts with a single crochet, add one more chain to your foundation.</p>
    <p>Hold the foundation with your non-dominant hand and insert the hook in the front loop of the second chain from the hook. The chains should look like braids when facing you.</p>
    <p>Then make the hook go under the working yarn and pull it through the loop you entered from.</p>
    <p>Now that you have two (2) loops on your hook, go under the working yarn and pull it through both loops on your hook. That is how you make a single crochet.</p>
    <p>Repeat on all chains in your foundation.</p>

<h2>Half-Double Crochet</h2>
    <p>If your pattern starts with a half-double crochet, add two more chains to your foundation.</p>
    <p>After that, go under the working yarn and then insert the hook on the third chain from your hook.</p>
    <p>After inserting your hook, go under the working yarn and pull through the chain you entered from.</p>
    <p>Once you have three (3) loops on your hook, pull the working yarn through all the loops on your hook.</p>
    <p>Now that you made a half-double crochet repeat the next chains in your foundation but skip chains.</p>

<h2>Double Crochet</h2>
    <p>When you are familiar with the half-double crochet, you can make the double crochet.</p>
    <p>First, add three (3) more chains to the foundation and follow all the steps for half-double crochet, but stop when you have three (3) loops on your hook.</p>
    <p>Pull the working yarn on only two (2) loops first, which will make another loop on the hook, making two (2) current loops on the hook.</p>
    <p>Then pull the working yarn in the last two (2) loops to finish the crochet.</p>
    <p>Repeat on all chains in the foundation.</p>

<h2>Treble Crochet</h2>
    <p>The hook should go under the working yarn twice.</p>
    <p>Then insert the hook in the front loop of the fourth chain from the hook.</p>
    <p>Pull the working yarn through the loop you entered from.</p>
    <p>Pull the working yarn in loops of two (2) until there is one (1) loop left.</p>
    <p>Then repeat throughout the foundation.</p>

<h2>Fastening and Finishing the project</h2>
    <p>To finish your project, chain once and cut off around 3-5 inches from your working yarn and pull it tight to make tie it all together.</p>
