Apply either a pencil grip or a knife grip.", "Make a slip knot by holding your index and middle finger on your non-dominant hand. Then wrap the yarn around your fingers to form an 'X', starting from the bottom left to upper right in front of your fingers, upper right to down right on the back of your fingers, then down right to upper left. after that, pass the working yarn(The yarn piece connected to the skein/ball of yarn) and tighten and adjust the yarn to your liking.", "Then start chaining by inserting your hook through the loop of your slip knot and pulling the working yarn through. Repeat until you have your desired length. This will serve as your foundation.", "If your pattern starts with a single crochet, start by adding one more chain to your foundation. Hold the foundation with your non-dominant hand and insert the hook in the front loop of the chains, the chains should look like braids when facing you. Then make the hook go under the working yarn and pull it through the loop you entered from. Now that you have two(2) loops on your hook, go under the working yarn and pull it through both loops on your hook. That's how you make a single crochet. Repeat on all chains in your foundation.", "If your pattern starts with a half-double crochet, start by adding two more chains to your foundation. After that, go under the working yarn and then insert the hook on the third chain from your hook."]
