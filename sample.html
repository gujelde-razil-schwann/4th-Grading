Apply either a pencil grip or a knife grip.", "Make a slip knot by holding your index and middle finger on your non-dominant hand.", "Then wrap the yarn around your fingers to form an 'X', starting from the bottom left to upper right in front of your fingers, upper right to down right on the back of your fingers, then down right to upper left.", "After that, pass the working yarn(The yarn piece connected to the skein/ball of yarn) and tighten and adjust the yarn to your liking.", "Then start chaining by inserting your hook through the loop of your slip knot and pulling the working yarn through.", "Repeat until you have your desired length. This will serve as your foundation.", "If the pattern you are following has a magic ring/circle foundation, follow the steps of the 'X' of a slip knot and pull the working yarn through only a little bit.", "Then twist the hook clockwise facing away from you.", "Start chaining for how many your pattern needs.", "If your pattern starts with a single crochet, start by adding one more chain to your foundation.", "Hold the foundation with your non-dominant hand and insert the hook in the front loop of the second chain from the hook, the chains should look like braids when facing you.", "Then make the hook go under the working yarn and pull it through the loop you entered from.", "Now that you have two(2) loops on your hook, go under the working yarn and pull it through both loops on your hook.", "That's how you make a single crochet.", "Repeat on all chains in your foundation.", "If your pattern starts with a half-double crochet, start by adding two more chains to your foundation.", "After that, go under the working yarn and then insert the hook on the third chain from your hook.", "After inserting your hook, go under the working yarn and pull through the chain you entered from.", "Once you have three(3) loops on your hook, pull the working yarn through all the loops on your hook.", "Now that you made a half-double crochet, repeat the next chains in your foundation, but skip chains.", "When you are familiar with the half-doube crochet, you can make the double crochet.", "First add three(3) more chains to the foundation and do all the steps on how to make a half-double crochet but stop on the part where you have three(3) loops on your hook.", "Pull the working yarn on only two(2) loops first, that will make another loop on the hook making two(2) current loops on the hook.", "Then pull the working yarn in the last two(2) loops to finish the crochet.", "Repeat on all chains in the foundation.", "Lastly, is how to make a treble crochet.", "The hook should go under the working yarn twice.", "Then insert the hook in the front loop of the fourth chain from the hook.", "Pull the working yarn through the loop you entered from.", "Pull the working yarn in loops of two(2) until there's one(1) loop left.", "Then repeat throughout the foundation."]
